    <h3>I like Games!</h3>
    <p>
      I like games because it allows me to do things I would not be able to in
      the real world. I can fly in games, I can have superpowes in games, I can
      see the imaginations of people who I would never have known otherwise.

    <h3>I like food!</h3>
    <p>
      I really like food because it is something that my body needs to funtion
      at its maximum capacity. Food also has taste which I really enjoy, there
      are many different dishes one can make and many different tastes one and
      taste and this allows us to experience new feelings.

    <h3>I like science!</h3>
    <p>
      I truly like how you can learn new and amazing skills that will help you
      in all fields of the world. It allows your to have a better understanding
      of how and why our world works the way it does. You can calculate things
      that seemed impossible and unachivable.
